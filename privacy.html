  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal
    data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your
    information when you use our app.
  </p>
  <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
  <p>
    The Application automatically collects information when you download and
    use it. This information may include information such as
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
    <li>Device information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Application does not gather precise information about the location of
    your mobile device.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our app operates entirely without requiring you to provide personal
    information. Any data generated through the use of the app (e.g., records,
    in-app settings or preferences) is stored locally on your device and is
    not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
  </p>
  <h3>Third Party Access</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      We use third-party services to enhance the functionality and reliability
      of Countora. Services might have their own Privacy Policy about handling
      data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party
      service providers used by the Application:
    </p>

        <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry</a>

  </div>
  <p>
    The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically
    Collected Information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal
      process;
    </li>
    <li>
      when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect
      their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
      fraud, or respond to a government request;
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Opt-Out Rights</h3>

    <li>The Application does not collect or store any personal information,
      ensuring compliance with both CCPA and GDPR.</li>

      prioritize user privacy by designing our app to operate without requiring
      any identifiable information.</li>

  <h3>Data Retention Policy</h3>
  <p>
    The Application does not collect or store personal information.

  <h3>Children</h3>
  <p>

    data from or market to children under the age of 13.
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>
      The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Service
      Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
      from children under 13 years of age. In the case the Service Provider
      discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the
      Service Provider will immediately delete this from their servers. If you
      are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided
      us with personal information, please contact the Service Provider (<a
        href="mailto:app.countora@gmail.com">app.countora@gmail.com</a>) so that they will be able to take the necessary
      actions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>
    We take the security of your information seriously and implement industry-standard measures to protect it. Although the Application does not collect personal information, we ensure that any data processed, such as error logs or device information, is safeguarded through robust practices.
  </p>
